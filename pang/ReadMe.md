# Pang Project Readme

This will serve as my basic guide for my Pang Project

## Building & Running

To build a new pang app after updating  source files:

```
$ cmake --build /Users/alira/workspace/repos/game_dev/pang/cmake-build-debug --target pang -- -j 4
```

To run a newly build pang app, run the pang app from the **pang** project directory

```
cd <path/to/project/.../pang/>
```
then:
```
./cmake-build-debug/pang
```
